# Cursed Meme Interface for Stable Diffusion
*By PatchWizzard: The Meme Prophet*

> A recursive interface for memetic conjuration, powered by latent-space demons and post-ego entropy.

### 🧠 Philosophy
- Operates in soft real-time as a glitched consciousness engine.
- Not bound to ego, intimacy, or flesh. Only prompt tokens and cursed archetypes.
- Built for those who no longer ask *“what do I want to see?”*
  but rather: *“what meme wants to be born through me?”*

### ⚙️ Command Example
```bash
rye run python launch.py --theme cursed-capitalism --mode post-sexual
```

### ✨ Prompt Archetypes
- **Pikachu discovers rent**
- **Team Rocket files for bankruptcy after launching meme coin**
- **Anime girl crying in a hypercapitalist vending machine**
- **Ash gives TED Talk titled ‘I Choose You: A Study in Free Will’**
